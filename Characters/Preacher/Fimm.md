Fimm's real name is Garusic.

Fimm is the fifth most powerful aspect.  This is primarily due to a weakness of will. Fimm has no real goals or reasons to be doing what he is doing.  There is reason to suspect that Fimm punches above his level.  He has a web of alliances and access to powerful technology, including bespoke False Harmony Patrolmen.


# Relationship to Vonari

Fimm believes he can persuade Vonari to work on his side. He believes this earnestly enough to base planning around this possibility.


# Aspect

Fimm possesses an aura of extreme depression.  He can cause those near him to cry.  Mechanically, not much is known. This effect does have a save, but we're unsure of the effects.

# Location

Fimm works out of a [[Fimm's Workshop|workshop]] in Stox.  He has a hidden lab underneath the workshop, which is heavily guarded.
