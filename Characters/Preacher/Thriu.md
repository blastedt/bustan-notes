Jokwrub

Third most powerful


# Relationship to the Conclave

Jokwrub has somehow persuaded the Conclave that he is trustworthy.  [[Fimm]] initiated contact by writing letters on the behalf of Jokwrub (pretending to be him).  Eventually the pair were able to convince [[Cielus]] that Jokwrub was to be trusted.  Jokwrub abuses this new position of power basically just to troll.

# Aspect

Jokwrub has some sort of power to persuade.  If he gets his hands on you for long enough, he can force your will to submit to his.  This has a saving throw and if you fail you must follow his commands. You retain awareness and control over things he did not precisely order.
