# Downtime
## Week 4
- Heading to Eirine
- Teammates close their eyes
- Cal attempts to use a mirror, is caught by Vonari, blindfolds themselves
- Villagers notice that we've brought additional people
- Cal and Wielder drew weapons
- Happy's father knows Ira
- Mr. Fizzelbang says Eirine is traumatized like a sailor who survived a kraken
- Preacher's name is Nulla, he is the cardinal Aspect
	- has all the aspects
- controls all the other aspects
- determines nature of humanity (as he says)
- got the power from shadepool
- strongest of will and power
- aspects can block his connection to shadepool
- Garusic had a plan for eventually defeating him
- Fimm is Garusic
- Wielder was brought back at the same time as Garusic - possibly by same people
- Wielder mentions a name "Garyllmyre"
- Korakowski taught her to use a gunscythe
- Guy in the Azure is "The Prisoner"
- "Other Eirine" took over and told him the aspect was Rage
- Fimm has a workshop in Stox
- Don't think Jokwrub and Fimm are good people
	- Don't know about Garusic
- Nulla = Preacher
- Einn is strange
- Tvaer
- Jokwrub = Thrju
- Eirine = Fyorir, also Foxrine was removed
- Garusic = Fimm
- Einn is the one who split Eirine into three
- Wielder really wants to give "consequences"  to the normal people 
- Happy visiting Magpie
- "Allegiance has shifted to another"
- Happy is feeling guilty
- "Relieved of duty" - will take back with open arms if she comes back to Magpie
- She has done too much good for the Magpie
- Living Light may be the downfall of the Magpie


# My Downtime
- Last episcopotas is called Driere
- She is the least formal and even more eccentric than Cielus
- Paladin that jumps off tall things to make an entrance
- Driere is late because she's doing something no one asked for
- She has the mentality of a storybook hero
- feels like she has to be better than the average person (morally), will help randoms, conclave usually charges so they get mad

## Aelisist in Sprawl Investigation
- Mafia families now working together, unrelated

# Wielder
- Went to Fimm's workshop, it was creepy, healed some plague.  I missed a lot

# Cal
- Fixing damage around Slaypool
- Using her Niarae stuff to help cleanse waters


# Ceremony
Fate recognized us
Gave us all ominous advice
"your mom says hi" to isaac (???)

# Scoping out Fimm's workshop
- There is a non-warforged there working as "Garusic"
- Bronze skin, blonde hair
- Fimm is making a mech suit
- Has a wall with a keypad that opens a trapdoor and wall
- Fimm has a man costume
- doing something to harmony patrolmen
- firecalls nulla/preacher
- fimm is creating the army
```
"Things are going fairly according to plan"
"dunno what the hell jokwrub is doing"'
"new aspects"
have you made contact
 of course i have
 i think we can convert vonari
 implying that the rising are aspects
 should NOT use jokwrub to convert us because we might resist
 should begin to let the nightmares loose
 targeting the conclave to spread fear
 nulla: might interfere with einn's plans
 fimm: but i am more competent at planning so who cares
 n: i dont trust you or einn but i believe you want my spot and you want it in as good a spot as possible. einn just wants chaos
 f: sir i could never take your place im far weaker
 n: i am not stupid i know you have been making deals with many people. your alliance web is nothing compared to my str. but know this: should the rising prove to be more competent than you, i will have them replace you in a heartbeat. prove your worthiness now

 ```
- fimm very happy with that convo
- happy steals some firecall powder and its attuned to the preacher (!!)
 - not stealing HP armor anymore, making it bespoke
 - FIMM IS THE ONE ARRANGING CONCLAVE-JOKWRUB
 - letters are sent specifically to cielus
 - code is 3489 found in letters between jokwrub and fimm


# Mafia

- Underground Delegation wants to talk to us
- Meant to free the city
- Alliance of mafia?
- Nalphrey has been bulking to become a better mafiaman
- Head down underground through a secret wall in the bottom of a restaurant
- Must be a lot of ways in since we didnt like go anywhere, we were just eating at the restaurant
- Anti capcris and anticonclave
